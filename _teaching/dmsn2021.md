This year I am giving some of the tutorials for the EECS module Digital Media and Social Networks, lectured by [Laurissa Tokarchuk](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~laurissa/Laurissas_Pages/About_Me.html) and [Mathieu Barthet](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/profiles/barthetmathieu.html). After each tutorial, my slides and code will be available on this page.

Some reading I would recommend is:
* [Networks: an Introduction](https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Networks.html?id=LrFaU4XCsUoC&redir_esc=y), by Mark Newman. It was the first book that I read in my PhD and gives a good foundation of the mathematics underlying network science. Should be available in the QMUL library.
* Network Science, by Albert-Laszlo Barabasi. Another great book covering a wide range of topics in network science, available in a nice format [online](http://networksciencebook.com/).
