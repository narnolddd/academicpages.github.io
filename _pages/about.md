I am Naomi Arnold, PhD student within the [Networks group](https://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/research/view/networks) in the [School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science](https://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/) at [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/). My supervisors are [Richard Clegg](https://www.richardclegg.org) and [Raul Mondragon](https://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~raul/Rauls_page.html). My research interests are currently in the analysis and modelling of dynamic networks, with a particular enjoyment of studying online social networks, but more generally anything that can be considered a network.
